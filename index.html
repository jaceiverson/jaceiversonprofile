  <p>Hey, I'm Jace.</p><br>
  <p>
    I am currently a solutions analyst for ICON Health and Fitness.
    Although I have enjoyed my time with ICON, I am following my cute wife across the country for her to pursue
    her master's degree in Speech Pathology. We are moving to Syracuse and I am looking for a job.  I consider myself a
    quick learner and love to take on new tasks.
    I enjoy using Python, Tableau, and SQL to help automate the different reporting processes and make time for the important decisions.
    I have most passion in finding creative solutions to problems I am facing.

    <p>How I got here:</p><br>
  <p>
    I graduated from Utah State University (Logan, UT) in Management Information Systems (MIS) December 2019.
    As a proud Aggie, I learned the merits of hard work and collaboration; USU also provided me with an incredible international
    experience in India. I met new friends and met with global businesses such as Amazon, IBM, and Honeywell.  With my diverse
    technical and cultural experience I will help improve your company day by day.

    I am most proud of my API project with Riot games. Being a fan of video games I worked on a project using Python and one of
    its frameworks (Flask) to create a site that pulled data from my own API. The API included GET, POST, and DELETE functionality.

    Of course I couldn't be where I am today without my cute wife. She drives me to be a better person and is the kindest person
    I know. After a year of marriage I have learned my wife is always correct and to find joy in the good times.  My wife is
    one of the most dedicate people I know that that is why we are moving across the country for her to get her master's degree.
    I couldn't be happier to follow her on her dream to be a speech therapist.

    A little about me
    <br><br>
    I like to have a good time and enjoy playing games, being outdoors,
    watching YouTube (yes it is possible to like both), and spending time
    with my wife. When I am not working a personal project you can find me
    watching sports or whatever series me and my wife are into right now.
    <br><br>
    Enjoy the site.
