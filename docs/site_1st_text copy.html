I am a data analyst for ICON Health and Fitness. Currently I am working on projects for various stages of the supply chain. I enjoy using Python, Tableau, and SQL to help automate the different reporting processes and make time for the important decisions. I graduated from Utah State University in Logan, UT in Management Information Systems.  As a proud Aggie, I learned the merits of hard work and collaboration; I use these skills to help ICON improve day by day.
