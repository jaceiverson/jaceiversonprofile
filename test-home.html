  <p>Hey, I'm Jace.</p><br>
  <p>
I am currently a solutions analyst for ICON Health and Fitness.
    Although I have enjoyed my time with ICON, I am following my cute wife across the country for her to pursuit of a
    master's degree in speech-language pathology. We are moving to Syracuse, so I am looking for a job.
    I consider myself a quick learner and love to take on new tasks. I enjoy using Python, Tableau, and SQL to
    help automate the different reporting processes and make time for the important decisions.
    I am most passionate about finding creative solutions to problems.

    <p>How I got here:</p><br>
  <p>
I graduated from Utah State University (USU) in Management Information Systems (MIS) December 2019.
    As a proud Aggie, I learned the merits of hard work and collaboration.
    USU also provided me with an incredible international experience in India.
    I made new friends and met with global businesses such as Amazon, IBM, and Honeywell.
    With my diverse technical and cultural experiences, I will help improve your company day by day.

    Of course I couldn't be where I am today without my wife.
    She drives me to be a better person and is the kindest person I know.
    After a year of marriage I have learned my wife is always correct and it’s important to find joy in the good times.
    My wife is one of the most dedicated people I know, and that is why we are moving across the country for her master's degree.
    I couldn't be happier to follow her on her dream to be a speech therapist.

    A little about me
    <br><br>
I like to have a good time — playing games, being outdoors, watching YouTube (yes it is possible to like both),
      and spending time with my wife. When I am not working on a personal project,
      you can find me watching sports or whatever series my wife and I are into at the moment.
    <br><br>
    Enjoy the site.
